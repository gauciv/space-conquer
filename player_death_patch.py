# This patch file contains the changes needed to fix player death handling in test mode

# 1. In the player's take_damage method, we've already updated it to handle death logic completely
# and return early if in test mode to prevent further game over processing.

# 2. For all other places in the code where player death is handled, we need to remove them
# since the player's take_damage method now handles everything.

# The following lines should be removed from the GameManager:
# - if damage_applied and self.player.health <= 0:
#   - self.game_state = self.GAME_STATE_GAME_OVER
#   - self.game_active = False
#   - self.sound_manager.play_sound('game_over')
#   - if self.sound_manager.music_enabled:
#       - self.sound_manager.temporarily_lower_music(duration=1500)
#   - pygame.time.set_timer(pygame.USEREVENT + 1, 1500)

# These lines should be replaced with:
# - if damage_applied and self.player.health <= 0:
#   - pass  # Death is handled in the player's take_damage method
