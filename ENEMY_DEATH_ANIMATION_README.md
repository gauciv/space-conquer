# Enemy Death Animation Enhancement

This update adds satisfying death animations and sound effects for enemies in Space Conquer.

## Features Added

### Visual Effects
- **Explosion Animation**: When enemies are destroyed, they now display a visually appealing explosion animation instead of just disappearing
- **Particle Effects**: Each enemy type has unique particle effects with different colors and behaviors
- **Flash Effect**: A bright flash appears at the beginning of the explosion for added impact
- **Expanding Ring**: A colored ring expands outward as part of the explosion effect

### Sound Effects
- **Custom Death Sound**: Added a dedicated sound effect for low-type enemy destruction
- **Sound Variety**: Different enemy types can have different destruction sounds
- **Fallback System**: If the custom sound isn't available, it falls back to the standard explosion sound

## Technical Implementation

### New Files
- `src/sprites/enemy_enhanced.py`: Enhanced enemy class with death animation capabilities
- `tools/create_enemy_death_sound.py`: Script to generate the enemy death sound effect

### Modified Files
- `src/game_manager.py`: Updated to use the enhanced enemy class and handle death animations
- `src/utils/sound_manager.py`: Added support for the new enemy death sound

## How It Works

1. When an enemy's health reaches zero, instead of immediately removing it:
   - The death animation sequence is triggered
   - Explosion particles are created based on enemy type
   - The appropriate sound effect is played

2. During the animation:
   - Particles move outward from the explosion center
   - A ring expands from the center
   - A bright flash appears briefly at the start
   - All effects fade out over the animation duration

3. After the animation completes (about 300ms), the enemy sprite is removed

## Future Improvements

- Add more variety to death animations based on enemy type
- Implement screen shake for larger explosions
- Add debris that persists after explosions
- Create different sound variations for more variety
