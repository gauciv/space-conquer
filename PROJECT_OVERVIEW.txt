Space Conquer - Comprehensive Project Overview
===============================================

Overview
--------
Space Conquer is a modern, Python-based side-scrolling shooter inspired by the classic Space Impact game from Nokia phones. This project aims to deliver a nostalgic yet enhanced arcade experience, featuring improved graphics, dynamic sound, and a modular, extensible codebase. Designed for both players and developers, Space Conquer is easy to play, modify, and expand.

Purpose & Vision
----------------
- **Recreate Nostalgia:** Faithfully reimagines the Space Impact gameplay with modern visuals and sound.
- **Modular Design:** Encourages community-driven enhancements, new content, and easy maintenance.
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with a one-click launcher and automatic setup.

Core Features
-------------
- **Diverse Enemies:** Multiple enemy types (low, elite, super, mini-boss, boss) with unique movement and attack patterns.
- **Power-Ups:** Collectible items (health, speed, rapid fire, score multiplier) dropped by asteroids and enemies.
- **Dynamic Audio:** Separate SFX and music channels with in-game volume sliders. Music adapts to game state (menu, gameplay, boss fight).
- **Modern UI:** Animated, glowing panels for score and health. In-game settings menu with stylized controls.
- **Developer Tools:** Hidden robot button unlocks a testing panel for god mode, player coordinates, and FPS display.
- **Game States:** Distinct start, gameplay, settings, and game over screens, each with unique transitions and UI.
- **Asset Management:** Manifest-driven asset loader for images, sounds, music, and maps. Easy to update or add new assets.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Organized modules for sprites, UI, asset management, backgrounds, and game logic.
- **Utility Scripts:** Tools for asset cleanup, manifest updates, and content generation in the `tools/` directory.

Gameplay & Controls
-------------------
- **Movement:** Arrow keys to move your ship.
- **Shooting:** SPACE to fire.
- **Settings:** ESC to open the in-game settings panel.
- **Objective:** Destroy enemies, avoid obstacles, collect power-ups, and achieve the highest score.
- **Progression:** Survive waves of enemies, defeat mini-bosses and bosses, and play until all health is lost.

Project Structure
-----------------
- `main.py`: Game entry point.
- `src/`: Source modules (game manager, config, UI, sprites, asset management, etc.).
- `assets/`: Images, sounds, music, and map files, organized by type and theme.
- `tools/`: Scripts for asset management, testing, and content creation.
- `run_game.py`: Cross-platform launcher script.
- Documentation: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CREDITS.md`, `RELEASE.md`.

Extending & Customizing
-----------------------
- **Add Enemies/Power-Ups/Maps:** Place new assets in the appropriate folders and update manifest files.
- **Change Music/Sounds:** Replace or add files in `assets/music/` and `assets/sounds/`.
- **Modify UI/Game Logic:** Edit modules in `src/` for new features or gameplay tweaks.
- **Use Tools:** Leverage scripts in `tools/` for batch asset operations and testing.

Developer & Testing Features
